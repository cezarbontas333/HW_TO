# HW_TO
University project for Optimization class, for solving a linear programming problem + Greedy problem, using Julia + JuMP + HiGHS.

# Problem description:
The problem is as follows
A manager working for a toy distribution company has to renew the truck fleet with a limited budget. They know what toy lines they sell, their profit generated, volume occupied and weight, while they also know the price of a truck, the volume and weight that those can carry at a maximum for each run. The task is to calculate what type of trucks and how many of each can the manager order that is under the budget.

# Additional notes
Code has some comments, but they are in Romanian. The files has the following role:
1. structuri.jl -> defines the toy (jucarii) and truck (tir) structures
2. CalcTir.jl -> gives the maximum profit generated by a truck
3. GreedyTir.jl -> calculates the types of trucks and number of them based on the Greedy method
4. testare.jl -> a script to test the functions
